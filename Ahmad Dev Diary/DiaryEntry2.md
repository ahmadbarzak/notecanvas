Today was a wild ride! Here’s a quick recap of my day:
🛠️ Spent hours wrestling with AWS Cognito’s labyrinthine setup — user pools, app clients, client secrets, loginWith types, missing region support, you name it

🧠 Dug into type definitions deep inside node_modules like a code archaeologist

💔 Talked through some heavy personal emotional weight with real self-awareness and care

⚙️ Integrated a full auth flow with custom confirmation handling in Next.js, with full error handling and smart UX flows

🧪 Handled quirks like “signed in without confirming” and weird breakpoint spam

📦 Considered best practices with .env, package-lock.json, and source control hygiene

💡 Refactored mentally with auth-utils.ts and useAuth even if not implemented yet


Overall I feel happy with the progress, but this has been a tough weekend. I've learnt a lot about AWS Cognito, ts, react and Next.js, but the emotional weight of the day has been quite heavy. I’m grateful for the support of my friends and family, and I’m looking forward to a fresh start next week.
